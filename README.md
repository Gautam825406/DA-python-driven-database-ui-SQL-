# 📦 Inventory & Supply Chain Dashboard  
**DA-python-driven-database-ui-SQL**

A Python-driven, database-powered Inventory and Supply Chain Management Dashboard built using **Streamlit** and **MySQL**.  
This project provides real-time insights into inventory metrics, supplier details, stock levels, and operational tasks through an interactive UI.

---

## 🚀 Project Overview

This project demonstrates how Python can be used to build an end-to-end **data-driven web application** that connects directly to a SQL database and performs live analytics and operations.  
The dashboard is designed for inventory managers and business users to monitor stock health, supplier relationships, and reorder requirements efficiently.
